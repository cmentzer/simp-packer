# === simp_options::dns::servers ===
# A list of DNS servers for the managed hosts.
#
# If the first entry of this list is set to '127.0.0.1', then
# all clients will configure themselves as caching DNS servers
# pointing to the other entries in the list.
#
# If you have a system that's including the 'named' class and
# is *not* in this list, then you'll need to set a variable at
# the top of that node entry called $named_server to 'true'.
# This will get around the convenience logic that was put in
# place to handle the caching entries and will not attempt to
# convert your system to a caching DNS server. You'll know
# that you have this situation if you end up with a duplicate
# definition for File['/etc/named.conf'].

# === simp_options::fips ===
# Prepare system to use FIPS mode.
#
# simp_options::fips enforces strict compliance with FIPS-140-2.  All core SIMP modules
# can support this configuration. Enabling simp_options::fips here will enable
# FIPS on this puppet environment.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# (1) Be sure you know the security tradeoffs of FIPS-140-2 compliance.
#     FIPS mode disables the use of MD5 and may require weaker ciphers or key
#     lengths than your security policies allow.
# (2) If the system is currently in FIPS mode and you set this option to false,
#     the system will still work.  The reverse is not necessarily true.  See
#     SIMP documentation for instructions on how to safely convert a non-FIPS
#     system to a FIPS system.
#

# === sssd::domains ===

#
# * When `simp_options::ldap` is true, this field should include `LDAP`.

#   fail to start.

# === svckill::mode ===
# Strategy svckill should use when it encounters undeclared services.
#
# 'enforcing' = Shut down and disable all services not listed in your
#               manifests or the exclusion file
# 'warning'   = Only report what undeclared services should be shut
#               down and disabled, without actually making the changes
#               to the system
#
# NOTICE: svckill is the mechanism that SIMP uses to comply with the
# requirement that no unauthorized services are running on your system.
# Is it HIGHLY recommended that you set this to 'enforcing'. Please be
# aware that, if you do this, svckill will stop ALL services that are
# not referenced in your Puppet configuration.
svckill::mode: warning
